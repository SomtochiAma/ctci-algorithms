# This is a solution to algorithm questions in the CTCI book

This repository houses my answers to different chapters in the CTCI book. The solutions were first written on paper(as advised by the book) and then transferred here. Please not that the solutions are in no way optimal and more detailed solutions are given at the end of the book. This repository is basically to curate my first solutions.

I have also included comments to indicate the space and time complexity of my solution(s).
I have made effort to make the code clean, modular and easy to understand.
